# StellarParameters.jl
A code to analyse photospheric spectra and derive stellar parameters (Teff, logg, [Fe/H], [α/Fe], vsini)

WIP. Needs cleanup & docs.

The file 'Relatório.pdf' describes the work done & results. README.md describes the organization
of the code. However, both are in Portuguese (university project), so you might not be able to read it.
